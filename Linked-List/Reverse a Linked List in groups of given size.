Given a linked list of size N. The task is to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function) in the linked list.

#MY_CODE#

class Solution
{
    public static Node reverse(Node node, int k)
    {
        Node prev = null;
        Node nxt = null;
        Node curr = node;
        int count =0 ;
        while(curr!=null && count<k)
        {
            nxt = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = nxt;
            count++;
        }
        
        if(curr!=null)
            node.next = reverse(curr,k);
        
        return prev;
    }  
}
